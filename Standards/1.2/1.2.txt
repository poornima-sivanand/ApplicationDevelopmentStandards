# Why does this standard matter?

Understanding the people who use a service and what they want is critical to building a service that works for them. For example, users of a driver’s license renewal service include any Ontarian with a driver’s license.

It’s easy to make assumptions about users or be influenced by personal experiences. When thinking about users, it’s important to find people with different experiences and perspectives.

It's especially important to include people with disabilities early.

Get to know your users and their needs from their point of view – beyond the lens of the project.

Taking the time to understand the people who use your service will help:

deliver better solutions and service experiences
discover additional opportunities and insights
prevent wasted effort implementing the right idea in the wrong way
It’s helpful to define average users and the not-so-average users (also known as atypical users). Atypical users include those who may be extremely satisfied or extremely dissatisfied with the service. Atypical users are a great source of insight because their needs are generally amplified versions of the more average users.

Use the needs of atypical users as a compass to help articulate the challenges that more digitally savvy users will struggle to voice. This is critical to building tools that work for everyone and avoiding inequalities through digital services.

To inform service features, interview users and gather data to develop:

* user goals - written in this format: As a [user type], I want [some goal] so that [some reason]
* user personas - show user groups based on habits, personality, attitudes, abilities and motives
* user profiles - show user groups based on demographics such as gender, age, location, income and family

# What does this standard mean?

Service teams should learn as much as possible about the problem users need them to solve by:

doing user research to understand what users need - and, where relevant, secondary research and analysis
building quick, throwaway prototypes to test their hypotheses
using web analytics and other data that’s available (for example, from government call centres or third party services) to enhance their understanding of the problem

# How can you meet this standard

## In Discovery and Alpha stages
During the Discovery stage and Alpha stage the entire team should have spent a lot of time with end users and learned a lot about their needs. You should understand and be able to show evidence to demonstrate the following.

### Who are the users?
What about the users’ motivations, triggers, contexts are significant for your service?

### How can you find the users to invite them to participate in user research? 
You must include users with varying needs (such as needs arising from disability, cultural diversity, literacy and remoteness).

Consider all the users in the service including end users, users in government who are delivering the service, and key intermediaries (professional and personal network).

### What is the real task(s) that people are trying to achieve when they encounter your service?

### What is the ‘job’ people are trying to get done that your service is a part of? 
You need to describe this in words that real end users would use, not using government terminology.

### How are users currently doing the task your service aims to help them do?
Think about all key touch points, for example through journey maps.

### What other relevant government and non-government services are also in use at this time?

### Where are the pain points in the current experience?

### What are the user needs?

### What are the opportunities to remove or reduce the pain points? 

### How might we better meet the user needs? Demonstrate this through research, testing and validating possible solutions with prototypes.

### Are you designing the right thing?

### How have your insights from user research helped you to define your minimum viable product (MVP)?

### How does the MVP create value for users and government by better meeting user needs?

## In Beta stage

During the Beta stage your understanding of what your users value will have matured through testing design prototypes with them.

By the end of the Beta stage you should be able to show greater depth and diversity of knowledge on all of the points above from Alpha and Beta. You should also be able to show the following.

### How has your service been shaped by user needs?
Show how you have made changes in the service and interaction design in response to user research and usability testing.

You can evidence this by showing how the design has changed over time and the appropriate research findings that have driven this change.

### How have you tested the system in the users’ context with a full range of users (including users with varying needs)?
You can evidence this with artefacts of research, for example, video clips and outcomes from research analysis.

### Are you prepared for ongoing user research?
Show how you plan to continue to test the system with users and the resources for this, for example through an ongoing research plan and budget.

### What have you not solved yet?
What the significant design challenges are, for example through key insights, how have you approached them? How do you plan to continue to tackle them?

### How will you know if your design is working?
Make sure that research has fed into the metrics you have developed to know that you continue to meet your user needs.

By the time you are ready to go live you should be able to show greater depth of knowledge for all the points above. You should also:

show how you are using data from real users to understand which parts of the task users are finding difficult, and how you are designing experiments to reduce friction and increase success for users
know how you will measure and monitor your service to ensure it is serving its users well
