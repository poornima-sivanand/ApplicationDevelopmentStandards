# How can you meet this standard?

If you are deploying a new service, consider to opensource your code and choose GitHub as your version control system.

If you are currently using subversion, irrespective of whether you are planning to lift and shift your application, move your source code to GitHub or Bitbucket based on whether you can opensource your code or not.
A sample script to move from Subversion to Bitbucket is given [here](assets/scripts/SVNtoBitbucket.sh).
