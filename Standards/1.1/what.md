# What does this standard mean?

Application development teams:

##### 1.1.a. should use modern distributed version control systems such as git, github, gitlab or bitbucket

##### 1.1.b. should use github for opensource code

##### 1.1.c. should use enterprise installations of git such as GitLab or Bitbucket for code that cannot be opensource

##### 1.1.d. should enable the use of multifactor authentication for all users accessing the code repository

##### 1.1.e. should use 'bcgov' org while storing opensource code in github

##### 1.1.f. should use [github flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) or [git flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) to manage version control

##### 1.1.g. should ensure master/main branch contains the code currently running in production

##### 1.1.h. should use relevant branch protection mechanisms to ensure the master/main branch cannot be deleted or modified without a pull request
